# How To Use

- Run `npm i`
- Check it out using `npm start`

# How Do I Customize

- Replace `homepage` in package.json to your domain name or `https://<username>.github.io`
- In `src/portfolio.js` you can add your personal portfolio details.
- In `src/theme.js` you can change the theme colors. You can change between Light and Dark theme with the theme switch on the header.

# How to Deploy

- Once you are done with your setup and have successfully completed all steps above, you need to put your website online!
- To deploy your website, you have two options. First you need to create a github repository with the name `<your-github-username>.github.io`. Please don't give it any other name.
- Now, you need to generate a production build and deploy the website.

**Option 1:**

- Run `npm run build` to generate the production build folder.
- Enter the build folder, `git init` and push the generated code to the `master` branch of your new repository. That's it. Done.
  You may need to `git init` and force push at every new build.


- Run `npm run deploy` to build and create a branch called `gh-pages`. It will push the `build` files to that branch.
- The last step in deploying is to enable `Github Pages` in settings of the repository and select `gh-pages` branch.

Now, your website is successfully deployed and you can visit it at `<your-github-username>.github.io`.
